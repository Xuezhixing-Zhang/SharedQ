# Plan And Goal

This checklist records current milestones for repository document management and simulation workflow continuity.

## Active Goal

Rebuild document management so all documents live in one top-level `docs/` folder, future agents know what to read and update, and Git commits/pushes happen after each milestone when the remote is reachable.

## Milestones

- [x] Milestone 1: Repair usable Git metadata.
  - External Git metadata initialized at `/tmp/SharedQ.git` because the workspace `.git` directory is read-only and invalid.
  - Remote configured as `git@github.com:Xuezhixing-Zhang/SharedQ.git`.
  - GitHub connector verified the remote repository exists and is empty.
  - SSH shell access to GitHub currently times out on port 22, so pushes may be blocked from this environment.

- [x] Milestone 2: Create document control files.
  - Create `docs/readme.md`.
  - Create `docs/plan and goal.md`.
  - Create `docs/2026-05-13_log.md`.
  - Commit and push the milestone if possible. Local commit is ready; shell push depends on SSH connectivity.

- [x] Milestone 3: Move all document files into `docs/`.
  - Move all markdown, text-like readme, working log, and `.docx` report files.
  - Use source-prefixed filenames to avoid collisions.
  - Update this checklist and today's log.
  - Commit and push the milestone if possible. Shell push is blocked until GitHub SSH credentials are fixed.

- [x] Milestone 4: Update stale references.
  - Update markdown references to moved documents.
  - Update `Simulation_random_walk/summarize_true_estimates.R` to write the generated summary into `docs/`.
  - Update this checklist and today's log.
  - Commit and push the milestone if possible. Push is ready to retry after the deploy key is added to GitHub with write access.

- [x] Milestone 5: Validate final layout.
  - Confirm all documents are under `docs/`.
  - Search for stale document paths.
  - Check Git status.
  - Record final verification notes.
  - Commit and push the milestone if possible. Local validation is complete; remote push is pending deploy-key write access.

## Current Notes

- Normal `git` commands do not work in this checkout because `.git` is an empty read-only directory.
- Use `git --git-dir=/tmp/SharedQ.git --work-tree=/data/cheungyb/home/e1404425/SharedQ ...` for local Git operations in this session.
- Do not move code, `.rds`, `.out`, images, or simulation data as part of this document-management task.
- Shell push attempts failed because `github.com:22` timed out and `ssh.github.com:443` authenticated as a deploy key without write permission.
- New deploy key generated at `/data/cheungyb/home/e1404425/.ssh/sharedq_deploy_key`; add its `.pub` value to GitHub with write access before retrying push.
